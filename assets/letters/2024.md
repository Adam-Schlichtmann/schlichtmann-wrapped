# Greetings!

Hope you all had a wonderful 2024! This year we decided to start a new tradtiion for our family. Starting in January of 2024 we kept track of some statistics. It started out with around ~25 different categories, but ultimately was pruned down to what you see below since some of the categories were either not interesting or too hard to keep track of. As the years come and go we hope to grow this to see how our lives change year over year.

Of course there are some yearly updates that cannot be tracked by numbers...

We spent most of our summer weekends at the lakes with family. Amos was not a huge fan of the water, but he would gladly take a nice nap on the pontoon. In August we took a family trip to Omaha, NE to visit friends. Amos got to go to the Henry Doorly Zoo for his first zoo visit. He mostly only enjoyed the aquarium. In September we atteneded 3 weddings between ND and SD.

## Adam

Adam continues to work remotely for DMSi as a Software Engineer. In June he ran his first half marathon and hopes to do it again many more times. He continued to curl at the FM Curling Club for Wednesday night leagues. In his free time he likes to work on wood working projects, play video games, or golf.

## Leah

This year marked Leah's first full year as a stay at home Mom. She keeps herself busy with taking care of Amos as well as caring for babies of friends and family as needed. In her free time she likes to read, do puzzles, or craft with her variety of crafting related toys/tools.

## Amos

Amos is no longer a baby (despite his parents still refering to him as "the baby"). Now that he is mobile, crawling in July and walking in September, he tries his best to get into anything and everything within his reach. He had a wonderful 1st birthday party surrounded by friends and family. His only issue was with the cake, it was **SCARY**! Gymnastic classes started in November and have been a hit! It took sometime to get acquanted with sitting still and listeneing for the first part of class, but he has improved a lot over the last month.

## Watson

Watson turned 2 this July and continues to be a lazy boy. He spends most of his days lying on the stairs or chasing Amos around hoping to get a snack when something is droppped. Watson has been a little unsure of Amos ever since he started walking, but will occasionally let Amos touch him.
